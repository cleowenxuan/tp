## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete John Doe")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* Stores the EventBook data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Tag` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTagList` object).
* Not modelled in diagram due to limitations of PlantUML: `UniqueTagList` object storing EventTags.
  * The `UniqueTagList` class involves the use of generics to allow it to store both `Tag` and `EventTag` objects.
  * Each EventBook stores a list of tags of type `UniqueTagList<Tag>` and a list of event tags of type `UniqueTagList<EventTag>`. However PlantUML is unable to capture the <Tag> and <EventTag> portion, hence we were unable to include the EventTag list in the diagram.
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Deleting Contacts by Index/Name

As student leaders will be in charge of multiple events, they encounter a large number of contacts to be saved. By incorporating a delete feature in EventBook to allow student leaders to swiftly delete contacts either by name or index, it streamlines their workflow, sparing them the effort of manually sifting through extensive contact lists before deletion.

This proposed delete feature introduces the concept of deleting the contacts by either name or index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list of contacts in the EventBook.

Step 2: The user executes `delete John Doe` command to delete the person named John Doe in the EventBook.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command fails the execution, it means that the person does not exist and an error indicating that the person is not found will be shown.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a delete operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (Proposed Choice):** Delete the name from the address book.
    * Pros: Easy to search for the person by typing their full exact name.
    * Cons: May have some issues with typing the full exact name if the person's full name that you want to delete is unknown to you.

* **Alternative 2:**  Search for the name of the person and delete the index from the address book.
    * Pros: Able to see which name you want to delete by searching for their name.
    * Cons: Having to search and delete is slower than simply deleting the person by name.

### Editing Contacts by Index/Name
As student leaders manage multiple events, they often need to update contact information swiftly within EventBook. By introducing an edit feature, student leaders can efficiently modify contact details either by name or index, enhancing their productivity and streamlining their workflow.

This proposed edit feature introduces the capability to edit contacts by either their name or index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list of contacts in the EventBook.

Step 2: The user executes `edit John Doe p/97979797` command to edit the person named John Doe with the updated phone number in the EventBook.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command fails the execution, it means that the person does not exist and an error indication that the person is not found will be shown.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an edit operation goes through the `Logic` component:

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

<puml src="diagrams/EditActivityDiagram.puml" width="750" />

### Creating and Deleting Tag and EventTag Objects

The `ctag`, `dtag` and `devent` functions allow users to create and delete `Tag` and `EventTag` objects that are critical for EventBook to work.

#### Implementation

##### `ctag` Command
* The `ctag` command is facilitated by the following set of classes:
  * CtagCommand
  * CtagCommandParser
* CtagCommand extends the Command class to allow it to interact with other predefined logic.
* CtagCommandParser extends the Parser class, and returns a CtagCommand object.
* In `CtagCommandParser::parse`, the user input is parsed to determine if a `Tag` object or an `EventTag` object is to
be created. This is done via specifying `t/E-` as the prefix for an `EventTag`
  * The appropriate CtagCommand object is then returned with either a `Tag` or `EventTag` object as a parameter.
* In `CtagCommand::execute`, the given object is then added to the model.

##### `dtag` Command
* The `dtag` command is facilitated by the following set of classes:
  * DtagCommand
  * DtagCommandParser
* In `DtagCommandParser::parse`, the user input is parsed to determine which `Tag` is to be deleted.
* In `DtagCommand:execute`, the provided Tag is then deleted if it exists.

##### `devent` Command
* The `devent` command is facilitated by the following set of classes:
    * DeventCommand
    * DeventCommandParser
* In `DeventCommandParser::parse`, the user input is parsed to determine which `EventTag` is to be deleted.
* In `DeventCommand:execute`, the provided EventTag is then deleted if it exists.

#### Storage of Tags

Every Tag and EventTag object that exists in the program must exist within a global Tag array. Existing functions such as
`add` will support the creation of Tag objects to be added to this global Tag array.

An example usage scenario illustrates how the `ctag` feature operates:
1. The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list
of contacts in the EventBook.
2. The user executes `ctag Friend`, creating a new Tag object named `Friend`.
3. The user can then tag people in the program with the new `Friend` tag.

An example usage scenario illustrates how the `dtag` feature operates:
1. The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list of
contacts in the EventBook.
2. The user executes `dtag Friend`, deleting the Tag object named `Friend`.
3. All instances of `Friend` will be deleted from the EventBook.


### Assign Tag command
The `assign` command allows users to assign Tags and Events to contacts within EventBook to be displayed as a label in
the main interface.

#### Implementation
* The `assign` command is facilitated by the following classes:
  * `AssignCommand` which extends Command
  * `AssignCommandParser` which extends Parser
* In `AssignCommandParser::parse`, the user input is parsed to determine the contact and the Tag / EventTag that is to
be assigned, and an `AssignCommand` object is returned.
* In `AssignCommand::execute`, the Person that is specified will have the respective tags assigned to them.

The `assign` command only takes in the index of the person to be assigned (as specified in the GUI), as well as a list of
`TAGNAME` or `t/E-EVENTTAGNAME` separated by spaces.

The following are the details of `AssignCommand::execute`:
1. LogicManager calls `AssignCommand::execute`
2. Within execute, `ModelManager::hasTag` and `ModelManager::hasEventTag` is called for each Tag and EventTag that is provided
to see whether the provided tags are valid.
3. If the tags / events do **not** exist, then an error is thrown.
4. Using `ModelManager::getFilteredPersonList` and the provided index, the Person object is retrieved.
5. Then, `ModelManager::assign` is called to assign the respective tags to the Person.

#### Changes to Person

In order to allow for assignment of `Tags` and `EventTags` to `Person` objects, `Person` was modified to be mutable.

Previously, `Person` was defined to be immutable such that no changes could be made to their tags or fields. With the
implementation of `assign`, changes had ot be made to allow mutability of each `Person` object's TagList and EventTagList. 

### Search by Tags command
The search by tag feature allows for easy searching of contact by `tag` to view people easily. This is achieved by filtering people in the contact list with the tags
to see if they have the tag you are searching assigned to them.

#### Implementation
* The Search feature is facilitated by the SearchCommand class which extends the Command class.
* In `SearchTagCommand::execute`, the input tag name provided by the user is checked to see it is an existing tag.
* If the tag already exists, the actual is used to update the filteredPersons list of Model class using the method 
`ModelManager::updateTagPersonList`. This allows the `filteredPersons` list to be updated to **show the correct contacts**.

The initial parsing of the search command follows the standard parsing process for all commands. Refer to the [Logic component](#logic-component) for the sequence diagram and details. <br>
<br>
The following are the details of the execute method of SwitchCommand:
1. LogicManager calls `SearchTagCommand::execute`
2. Within execute, `ModelManager::hasTag` is called to check whether a tag with the given name already exists.
3. If the tag exists, `ModelManager::updateTagPersonList` is called to update the contacts displayed with the given `tag`.
This will update the `filteredPersons` field of ModelManager class to only contain contacts with the particular Tag.
4. A new `CommandResult` object is created and this is returned by `SwitchCommand::execute` which displays a success message
that a tag was created. The message is stored in the `SearchTagCommand` class itself.
![](images/DG/SearchCommandExecute.png)


### Switch Event command
The event switching feature allows for easy switching between event tabs to view event members. This is achieved by the introducing event-specific filtering to EventBook.

#### Implementation
* The Switch feature is facilitated by the SwitchCommand class which extends the Command class. 
* In `SwitchCommand::execute`, the input tag name provided by the user is checked to see whether it is an existing event tag. 
* If the tag already exists, the actual `EventTag` is retrieved and used to update the filteredPersons list of Model class. This allows the `filteredPersons` list to be updated to **show the correct contacts**. 
* The `currentEventTag` field in Model class is also updated to the corresponding `EventTag`. This ensures that the highlighted tab in the EventPanelList switches to **highlight the correct Event**.

The initial parsing of the switch command follows the standard parsing process for all commands. Refer to the [Logic component](#logic-component) for the sequence diagram and details. <br>
<br>
The following are the details of the execute method of SwitchCommand:
1. LogicManager calls `SwitchCommand::execute`
2. Within execute, `ModelManager::hasEventTag` is called to check whether an event tag with the given name already exists.
3. If the event tag exists, `ModelManager::getEventTag` is called to retrieve the event tag required. 
4. Next, `ModelManager::updateEventTagPersonList` is called with the event tag retrieved. This will update the `filteredPersons` field of ModelManager class to only contain contacts with the particular EventTag. 
5. A new `CommandResult` object is created and this is returned by `SwitchCommand::execute`. The CommandResult object is called with the retrieved EventTag. 

![](images/SwitchCommandExecute.png)

#### Changes made to `CommandResult`:
In implementing this feature, `CommandResult` was updated to take in an additional field `EventTag` to facilitate the update of highlighted tabs for the `EventListPanel`. The following are the varying inputs for this addtional field by different Commands: <br>
* SwitchCommand creates a `CommandResult` with the **corresponding** `EventTag` to switch to. 
* ListCommand creates a `CommandResult` with the **default** `EventTag`.
* All other Commands creates a `CommandResult` with **null** for the `EventTag` field, since there is no need to change the highlighted tab when executing other commands. <br>
<br>

When `executeCommand::MainWindow` is called to update the UI after the execution of a command, it checks whether the `CommandResult` contains an `EventTag`: 
* If the `EventTag` **does not exist**, the highlighted tab in EventListPanel does not change. 
* If the `EventTag` **exists**, the eventListPanel is updated to highlight the correct tab:
  1. DEFAULT_TAG: `list` command was executed, call `EventListPanel::clearEventSelection` to switch highlighted tab back to `All` tab. 
  2. **Not** DEFAULT_TAG: `switch` command was executed, call `EventListPanel::selectEvent` with the EventTag to switch highlighted tab to corresponding Event tab. 

  
### Importing and Exporting as .csv file

The import/export commands allow one to easily share contact data.
As student leaders, a common and easily accessible file format type for event contacts would be .csv. 
Eventbook supports the ability to import and export contacts using .csv files to facilitate fast and effective contact upload and sharing.

#### Implementation (Export)
* The Export feature is facilitated by the ExportCommand class which extends the Command class.
* In `ExportCommand::execute`, a reference to the current model is passed to the `ExportCommand::exportFile` call
* `ExportCommand::exportFile` accesses the model's Person data through `model.getFilteredPersonList()`
* For each Person, `ExportCommand::exportFile` accesses their details through the respective getters (e.g.`Person::getName()`)
  and writes their details to a .csv file through a FileWriter object

An example usage scenario illustrates how the export feature operates:
1. The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list of contacts
   in the EventBook.
2. The user executes `export` to export all contacts
3. All contacts in the address book will be exported to ./export/export.csv according to the format given above

#### Implementation (Import)
* The Import feature is facilitated by the following classes:
    * `ImportCommand` which extends Command
    * `ImportCommandParser` which extends Parser
* In `ImportCommandParser::parse`, the user input is parsed to determine the path of the file to be imported,
  and an `ImportCommand` object is returned with the parsed path (a default path is given if none is specified)
* In `ImportCommand::execute`, a reference to the current model is passed and the following are called:
  * `ImportCommand::parse` parses the given file and stores the data in an `ArrayList` object. The data
  * `ImportCommand::checkFields` is called on the parsed data to check the fields. The field data is subsequently removed
  * `ImportCommand::addPersons` uses the parsed Person data and simulates adding them to the model through the Add command
  * `ImportCommand::loadEventTags` adds and assigns EventTags to the model separately, since the Add command does not support this functionality

An example usage scenario illustrates how the import feature operates:
1. The user launches the application. The application will be in its initial state showing the full list of contacts
   in the EventBook.
2. The user executes `import f/./import/import.csv` , with import.csv having 2 rows:
    1. `NAME,NUMBER,EMAIL,ADDRESS,EVENTS,TAGS`
    2. `John,94756383,john@mail.com,NUS,Orientation,BestFriend|Cool`
3. The contact `John` is imported into the address book, with parameters as above (He is assigned the existing EventTag Orientation as well)

#### Format of the .csv files
* The format of the first line of the csv should contain the fields:
  `NAME,NUMBER,EMAIL,ADDRESS,EVENTS,TAGS` (.csv is comma delimited, so that means each field should be in their own cell)

## **Appendix: Enhancement (Team Size 5)**

1. **To show custom error for wrong time in `ctag` command**: When creating event tags with the `ctag` command,
you will not get notified correctly on why you failed when you input the incorrect time(like 25:73:74 in the 24-hour 
format). We plan to make the error message also mention why failed and the reason for the failure: `Incorrect time input:
please check that your time is correct!`
2. **Help message in the `delete` command updates with spacing**: When displaying an error message prompting you to
input with the correct format for the `delete` command, the example given displays: `Example: delete 1ordelete JohnDoe`.
We plan to fix it to `Example: delete 1 or delete JohnDoe`.
3. **Allow only correct phone numbers to recognized as phone numbers**: For contacts' phone number, we currently allow
it to be any number value with size of `int` which can create some issues. We plan to make the phone number we add to
contact only valid phone numbers types like **+65 8888 8888** in singapore or **+1 (123) 123-1234** in the United States.
4. **New error message when creating tag or event tags that is not single-word or contains illegal characters with the `ctag` command**:
All tags and event tags in this app are strictly **one word only with and alphanumeric only(a-z, A-Z, 0-9)**.
When a person attempts to create tag or event tag with more than one word or contains illegal alphabet,
he/she currently will only get an error message that is not related what caused the command to fail. We plan to create an
custom error that will inform the user to that tag/event tag need to be one word with **legal characters(a-z, A-Z, 0-9) only**
when this mistake by the user occurs.
5. **Display all existing tags with a `taglist` command**: The current implementation **does not allow you to see all the existing tags 
within the EventBook** and this will cause some trouble for the user. For example, according to the user guide, when assigning a tag in the address book to a specified person,
the provided tag(s) must already exist in the EventBook. However, there is no accessible list of tags (not event tags) that have been added.
The absence of tag visibility aside from the ones you see beside contact panels in the app makes it challenging for users 
to remember if a tag was added when there are too many tags in the contact. We plan to create a new command that will
display all the tags that are in the address book with a command called `taglist`. For example, if I input `taglist`,
the app will display all the existing tags in the EventBook, with an output like `Tags: Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4`.
6. **Make the app window adjust to the correct size without whitespace when you try to change its size`**:
The current app's default display works fine but when trying to adjust the window, whitespace will appear at the bottom
of the app instead of adjusting the size of the whole window as shown below. ![](images/DG/DG_Enhancement_Window.png)
We plane to make the window readjust properly for the future app instead of displaying this whitespace.
7. **Length inputs to be displayed in full in the EventBook**: In the current implementation, 
lengthy inputs for the fields appear to not be displayed in full by the UI as shown in the image below. ![](images/DG/DG_Enhancement_Lengthy.png)
We plan to make the display in full for up to 3 lines' length of information in the contact panel.
8. **Import to support ignoring contacts that already exist**: The current implementation will throw an error
when importing a file contacts that have the same name as an existing contact. We plan to make it so the import
command will still import non-conflicting contacts when this happens.
